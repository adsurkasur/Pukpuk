# Pukpuk Forecasting Feature Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test the forecasting feature of Pukpuk using the enhanced import system and generated CSV datasets.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Generated Datasets**: Ensure you have run the dataset generation script:

   ```bash
   python generate_datasets.py
   ```

2. **Running Services**: Start both frontend and backend services:

   ```bash
   python start_services.py
   ```

3. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Load CSV Data into Database (Enhanced Import System)

1. **Open the Data Management Page**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/data`
   - You should see the enhanced "Import Data" section with a unified import button

2. **Check Current Data Status**:
   - Click "Check Data Status" to see if any data is currently loaded
   - Initially, it should show "Total Records: 0"

3. **Test Enhanced Import System**:
   - Click the **"Import Data"** button (single unified button)
   - Select a CSV file to import
   - The system will **automatically** choose the best import method:
     - **Bulk Import** (10-50x faster): For files >1MB or >100 rows
     - **Regular Import**: For smaller files
   - Watch the progress indicator during import
   - You should see a success message with import statistics

4. **Verify Data Loading**:
   - Click "Check Data Status" again
   - Should show the total number of imported records
   - View sample records to confirm data structure
   - Check that products appear in the forecast dropdown

### Step 2: Test Complete Data Clearing

1. **Clear All Data**:
   - Click the **"Clear All Data"** button
   - Confirm the action in the dialog (this removes ALL data from database)
   - Verify that all records are cleared (should show "Total Records: 0")

2. **Re-import Data**:
   - Use the enhanced import system again to reload data
   - Verify that the forecast page now shows products immediately

### Step 3: Explore Enhanced Data Management Page

1. **Browse the Data Table**:
   - Scroll through the data table to see all loaded records
   - Use pagination controls (bottom of table)
   - Test sorting by clicking column headers
   - Test filtering using the search box

2. **Data Summary Dashboard**:
   - View summary statistics at the top
   - Check category distribution, regional data, etc.

3. **Test Data Operations**:
   - Try adding new records using the inline form
   - Test editing existing records
   - Verify data persistence

### Step 4: Test Forecasting Feature (Enhanced Integration)

1. **Navigate to Forecast Page**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/forecast`
   - You should see the forecasting interface with products loaded from imported data

2. **Select a Product for Forecasting**:
   - Choose a product from the dropdown (populated from imported data)
   - The system will automatically fetch historical data from the database

3. **Configure Forecast Parameters**:
   - **Forecast Days**: Set to 30, 60, or 90 days
   - **Selling Price**: Enter a price (e.g., 50.00)
   - **Models**: Select forecasting models (SMA, WMA, ARIMA, etc.)
   - **Scenario**: Choose realistic, optimistic, or pessimistic

4. **Generate Forecast**:
   - Click "Generate Forecast" button
   - Wait for the analysis service to process the data
   - View the forecast results with confidence intervals

5. **Analyze Results**:
   - **Forecast Chart**: View predicted demand over time
   - **Confidence Intervals**: See upper and lower bounds
   - **AI Summary**: Read the generated insights
   - **Revenue Projections**: If selling price was provided

### Step 5: Test Performance with Large Datasets

1. **Large Dataset Testing**:
   - Import datasets with 10,000+ records
   - Monitor import time (should complete in seconds with bulk import)
   - Test forecast generation speed
   - Verify system responsiveness

2. **Import Method Comparison**:
   - Test with small files (<100 rows) → Uses regular import
   - Test with large files (>100 rows) → Uses bulk import automatically
   - Compare performance differences

### Step 6: Test Different Scenarios

1. **Product Variations**:
   - Test forecasting for different products (Rice, Wheat, Corn, etc.)
   - Compare results across different categories (Grains, Vegetables, Fruits)

2. **Time Horizons**:
   - Test short-term forecasts (7-30 days)
   - Test medium-term forecasts (30-90 days)
   - Test long-term forecasts (90-365 days)

3. **Model Comparisons**:
   - Compare results from different models (SMA vs ARIMA vs Ensemble)
   - Note accuracy differences and confidence levels

4. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - Test "Realistic", "Optimistic", and "Pessimistic" scenarios
   - Compare how different assumptions affect forecasts

### Step 7: Advanced Testing

1. **Data Filtering**:
   - Test forecasting with filtered data (specific regions, date ranges)
   - Verify that the forecast API correctly applies filters

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with large datasets (50,000+ records)
   - Monitor response times and system performance
   - Test concurrent imports and forecasts

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Test with insufficient historical data
   - Test with invalid product IDs
   - Test network connectivity issues
   - Test malformed CSV files

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (Updated)

### Common Issues

1. **Import Method Not Selected Correctly**:
   - Check file size (>1MB or >100 rows triggers bulk import)
   - Verify CSV format and headers

2. **Products Not Appearing in Forecast**:
   - Ensure data was imported successfully
   - Check browser network tab for API calls
   - Try refreshing the forecast page

3. **Clear All Not Working**:
   - Verify API endpoint `/api/demands/clear-all` is accessible
   - Check MongoDB connection and permissions

4. **Slow Import Performance**:
   - Large files should use bulk import automatically

   - Verify system has sufficient memory

5. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Check MongoDB is running
   - Verify connection string in environment variables
   - Test database connectivity

6. **Analysis Service Not Responding**:
   - Ensure analysis service is running on port 7860
   - Check `ANALYSIS_SERVICE_URL` environment variable
   - Verify service logs for errors

7. **Forecast Generation Fails**:
   - Check if selected product has sufficient historical data
   - Verify analysis service logs for errors
   - Test with different products or time ranges

8. **Data Not Appearing in Table**:
   - Refresh the data management page
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API endpoints are responding
   - Test cache invalidation

### Debug Steps
